TransformDemo

This is a simple 2D transform demo (mostly some 3D) written originally using Processing (java) , then translated into p5.js (javascript). These files can be downloaded then index.html can be executed in a web browser. The java script code for the sketch is located in sketch.js.

The goal of this demo is to show how one might draw an array of tiles with different orientations, i.e. rotated 0,90,180 or 270 degrees placed in an array with a given number of columns ("across the page") and a given number of rows ("down the page").
